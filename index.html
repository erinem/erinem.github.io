    <p>Ancestry.com is the largest for-profit genealogy company in the world (Wayner).
      Their mission is to "help everyone discover, preserve and share their family history"
      (About Ancestry).  It operates a "network of genealogical and historical record websites
      focused on the United States and nine foreign countries, develops and markets
      genealogical software, and offers a wide array of genealogical related services"
      (Wayner).  Ancestry.com has more than 2 million paying subscribers worldwide (About Ancestry).</p>

    <p>The software development engineers must be familiar with Java Tools, the Java Runtime
      Environment, CMS system or any Java/JSP CMS system, and various open source technologies.
      These engineers must be "proficient in SQL, database schema design and implementation
      (tables, queries, triggers, views, and stored procedures)" (Careers).  Individuals in
      this field must have a "solid Java/JSP/Spring/Templating experience" with an understanding
      of "full web technology stack (HTTP/HTTPS, Cookies, Headers, MVC)" (Careers).</p>

    <p>Some sections of Ancestry.com is run through data mining clusters using the Hadoop software
      library (Yetman).  Ancestry.com has a "well-established EDW that contains some very large data
      sets used to track customer behavior" (Yetman).  The engineers are moving those data sets into
      "Hadoop, aggregating them, and sending the results to the EDW" (Yetman).  There are Ancestry.com
      offices located all around the world.  They use Git because it offers "wide scale collaboration"
      as well as the ease of branching and merging projects (Shee).  This type of "code management is
      ideal for parallel development work used by open source projects" (Shee).</p>

    <p>Ancestry.com has an external API that is used by their mobile apps and "other strategic
      initiatives to share and update a person's family tree, events, stories and photos" (Madsen).
      Their external API has been most important in their mobile efforts so they are always looking
      for ways to improve and enhance their systems and application.  They recently made some changes
      that proved success with their mobile application:</p>

    <p><ul>
      <li>Pass Through: "Rather than aggregate [their] services at the API layer, [they] took the
        strategy of creating a "pass-through" layer back to [their] backend services. This put the
        responsibility directly on [their] services to further optimize their code, and in some
        cases, create new endpoints specifically with mobile usage in mind. This methodology also
        enabled the mobile teams to more effectively cache data according to their needs and
        Service team recommendations" (Madsen).</li>
      <li>Cashing: "Because [they] changed [their] API model to a pass-through, the mobile app
        could now cache data from each call at appropriate intervals thus taking pressure off of the
        backend services and network. This meant fewer calls (in the long run) to the external API"
        (Madsen).</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Ancestry.com "acquired a very exciting property called Find A Grave which focused on collecting
      content around the graves of family, loved ones and famous people" (Schultz).  The engineers
      were to manage a "successful transition and focus on new experiences" (Schultz). This was a
      challenge because Find A Grave "serves millions of page views a day, was running on a different
      web technology stack, sitting in a set of physical rack mount servers in a separate data center
      at the time, and contains over 100 million photos and over 116 million memorials" (Schultz).
      The objective of the project was to "transition all hardware and code to a modernized
      infrastructure within a short amount of time to provide the Find A Grave users with a better
      performing experience and support future scale and growth over the years" (Schultz).  The
      engineers started with the infrastructure.  The team was able to "migrate all infrastructure,
      photos, database and content to the Ancestry data center.  It was a very complex task as [they]
      needed to keep the existing site running live during this whole process.  [They] also wanted
      to modernize the infrastructure and virtualize everything in [their] private virtual cloud.
      Part of this was using Go for continuous integration and Chef for deployment and provisioning
      to [their] virtual instances.  This will allow [them] to scale to future growth beyond the
      acquisition" (Schultz).  Next, the team at Ancestry.com created a 1.0 iOS application (Schultz).
      They then focused on the backend of Find a Grave by building a web based application using
      Node.js because it "works perfectly for [their] JSON API layer, provided great real-time support
      for [their] iOS app and works great for some of the new NoSQL infrastructure" (Schultz).</p>
